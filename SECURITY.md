## Code of Conduct and Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines

When reporting security vulnerabilities, reporters must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **No Harmful Actions**: Security research and vulnerability reporting must not:
   * Cause damage to running systems or production environments.
   * Disrupt development or infrastructure.
   * Affect other users' applications or systems.
   * Include actual exploits that could harm users.
   * Involve social engineering or phishing attempts.

2. **Responsible Testing**: When testing potential vulnerabilities:
   * Use isolated, controlled environments.
   * Do not test on production systems without prior authorization.
   * Do not attempt to access or modify other users' data.
   * Immediately stop testing if unauthorized access is gained accidentally.

3. **Report Quality**
   * Provide clear, detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   * Include only the minimum proof of concept required to demonstrate the issue.
   * Remove any malicious payloads or components that could cause harm.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in rejection of the vulnerability report.
